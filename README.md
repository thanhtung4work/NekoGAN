## Overview 

Cat Scribbler GAN is a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model designed to generate realistic hand-drawn images of cats based on input sketches. The model utilizes data collected from the "Scribble It" game, where users draw sketches of cats. The GAN is trained to understand and reproduce these scribbles, creating visually appealing cat images.

## Features

- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN): The core of the project is a GAN architecture that is trained to generate high-quality cat images from input sketches.
- Scribble It Game Data: The model is trained on a dataset collected from the "Scribble It" game, which provides a diverse set of hand-drawn cat scribbles for improved generalization.
- Image Generation: The trained GAN can take a user-provided hand-drawn cat scribble as input and generate a cat image.
